Now the interface will recalculate as soon as the user input changes.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef calculator(num1, operation, num2):\n    if operation == \"add\":\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == \"subtract\":\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == \"multiply\":\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == \"divide\":\n        return num1 / num2\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    calculator,\n    [\n        \"number\",\n        gr.Radio([\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]),\n        \"number\"\n    ],\n    \"number\",\n    live=True,\n)\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/calculator_live'></gradio-app>\n\nNote there is no submit button, because the interface resubmits automatically on change.\n\n## Streaming Components\n\nSome components have a \"streaming\" mode, such as `Audio` component in microphone mode, or the `Image` component in webcam mode. Streaming means data is sent continuously to the backend and the `Interface` function is continuously being rerun.\n\nThe difference between `gr.Audio(source='microphone')` and `gr.Audio(source='microphone', streaming=True)`, when both are used in `gr.Interface(live=True)`, is that the first `Component` will automatically submit data and run the `Interface` function when the user stops recording, whereas the second `Component` will continuously send data and run the `Interface` function _during_ recording.\n\nHere is example code of streaming images from the webcam.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef flip(im):\n    return np.flipud(im)\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    flip,\n    gr.Image(sources=[\"webcam\"], streaming=True),\n    \"image\",\n    live=True\n)\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n\nStreaming can also be done in an output component. A `gr.Audio(streaming=True)` output component can take a stream of audio data yielded piece-wise by a generator function and combines them into a single audio file.
