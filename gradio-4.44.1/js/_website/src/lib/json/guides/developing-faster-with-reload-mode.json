Make sure to [read the Guide to Blocks first](https://gradio.app/blocks-and-event-listeners).\n\nThis guide covers auto reloading, reloading in a Python IDE, and using gradio with Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n## Why Auto-Reloading?\n\nWhen you are building a Gradio demo, particularly out of Blocks, you may find it cumbersome to keep re-running your code to test your changes.\n\nTo make it faster and more convenient to write your code, we've made it easier to \"reload\" your Gradio apps instantly when you are developing in a **Python IDE** (like VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm, or so on) or generally running your Python code from the terminal. We've also developed an analogous \"magic command\" that allows you to re-run cells faster if you use **Jupyter Notebooks** (or any similar environment like Colab).\n\nThis short Guide will cover both of these methods, so no matter how you write Python, you'll leave knowing how to build Gradio apps faster.\n\n## Python IDE Reload \ud83d\udd25\n\nIf you are building Gradio Blocks using a Python IDE, your file of code (let's name it `run.py`) might look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# Greetings from Gradio!\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n\n    inp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"Welcome, {x}!\",\n               inputs=inp,\n               outputs=out)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.launch()\n```\n\nThe problem is that anytime that you want to make a change to your layout, events, or components, you have to close and rerun your app by writing `python run.py`.\n\nInstead of doing this, you can run your code in **reload mode** by changing 1 word: `python` to `gradio`:\n\nIn the terminal, run `gradio run.py`. That's it!\n\nNow, you'll see that after you'll see something like this:\n\n```bash\nWatching: '/Users/freddy/sources/gradio/gradio', '/Users/freddy/sources/gradio/demo/'\n\nRunning on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860\n```\n\nThe important part here is the line that says `Watching...` What's happening here is that Gradio will be observing the directory where `run.py` file lives, and if the file changes, it will automatically rerun the file for you. So you can focus on writing your code, and your Gradio demo will refresh automatically \ud83e\udd73\n            <p class='tip'>\n                <span class=\"inline-flex\" style=\"align-items: baseline\">\n                    <svg class=\"self-center w-5 h-5 mx-1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"800px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"currentColor\">\n                        <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M9.25 18.7089C9.25 18.2894 9.58579 17.9494 10 17.9494H14C14.4142 17.9494 14.75 18.2894 14.75 18.7089C14.75 19.1283 14.4142 19.4684 14 19.4684H10C9.58579 19.4684 9.25 19.1283 9.25 18.7089ZM9.91667 21.2405C9.91667 20.821 10.2525 20.481 10.6667 20.481H13.3333C13.7475 20.481 14.0833 20.821 14.0833 21.2405C14.0833 21.66 13.7475 22 13.3333 22H10.6667C10.2525 22 9.91667 21.66 9.91667 21.2405Z\"/>\n                        <path d=\"M7.41058 13.8283L8.51463 14.8807C8.82437 15.1759 9 15.5875 9 16.0182C9 16.6653 9.518 17.1899 10.157 17.1899H13.843C14.482 17.1899 15 16.6653 15 16.0182C15 15.5875 15.1756 15.1759 15.4854 14.8807L16.5894 13.8283C18.1306 12.3481 18.9912 10.4034 18.9999 8.3817L19 8.29678C19 4.84243 15.866 2 12 2C8.13401 2 5 4.84243 5 8.29678L5.00007 8.3817C5.00875 10.4034 5.86939 12.3481 7.41058 13.8283Z\"/>\n                    </svg>\n                <span><strong>Tip:</strong></span>\n                </span>\n                the `gradio` command does not detect the parameters passed to the `launch()` methods because the `launch()` method is never called in reload mode. For example, setting `auth`, or `show_error` in `launch()` will not be reflected in the app.\n            </p>\n                \n\nThere is one important thing to keep in mind when using the reload mode: Gradio specifically looks for a Gradio Blocks/Interface demo called `demo` in your code. If you have named your demo something else, you will need to pass in the name of your demo as the 2nd parameter in your code. So if your `run.py` file looked like this:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as my_demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# Greetings from Gradio!\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n\n    inp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"Welcome, {x}!\",\n               inputs=inp,\n               outputs=out)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    my_demo.launch()\n```\n\nThen you would launch it in reload mode like this: `gradio run.py --demo-name=my_demo`.\n\nBy default, the Gradio use UTF-8 encoding for scripts. **For reload mode**, If you are using encoding formats other than UTF-8 (such as cp1252), make sure you've done like this:\n\n1. Configure encoding declaration of python script, for example: `# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-`\n2. Confirm that your code editor has identified that encoding format. \n3. Run like this: `gradio run.py --encoding cp1252`\n\n\ud83d\udd25 If your application accepts command line arguments, you can pass them in as well. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport argparse\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\nparser.add_argument(\"--name\", type=str, default=\"User\")\nargs, unknown = parser.parse_known_args()\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(f\"# Greetings {args.name}!\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox()\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n\n    inp.change(fn=lambda x: x, inputs=inp, outputs=out)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.launch()\n```\n\nWhich you could run like this: `gradio run.py --name Gretel`\n\nAs a small aside, this auto-reloading happens if you change your `run.py` source code or the Gradio source code. Meaning that this can be useful if you decide to [contribute to Gradio itself](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) \u2705\n\n\n## Controlling the Reload \ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f\n\nBy default, reload mode will re-run your entire script for every change you make.\nBut there are some cases where this is not desirable.\nFor example, loading a machine learning model should probably only happen once to save time. There are also some Python libraries that use C or Rust extensions that throw errors when they are reloaded, like `numpy` and `tiktoken`.\n\nIn these situations, you can place code that you do not want to be re-run inside an `if gr.NO_RELOAD:`  codeblock. Here's an example of how you can use it to only load a transformers model once during the development process.\n            <p class='tip'>\n                <span class=\"inline-flex\" style=\"align-items: baseline\">\n                    <svg class=\"self-center w-5 h-5 mx-1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"800px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"currentColor\">\n                        <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M9.25 18.7089C9.25 18.2894 9.58579 17.9494 10 17.9494H14C14.4142 17.9494 14.75 18.2894 14.75 18.7089C14.75 19.1283 14.4142 19.4684 14 19.4684H10C9.58579 19.4684 9.25 19.1283 9.25 18.7089ZM9.91667 21.2405C9.91667 20.821 10.2525 20.481 10.6667 20.481H13.3333C13.7475 20.481 14.0833 20.821 14.0833 21.2405C14.0833 21.66 13.7475 22 13.3333 22H10.6667C10.2525 22 9.91667 21.66 9.91667 21.2405Z\"/>\n                        <path d=\"M7.41058 13.8283L8.51463 14.8807C8.82437 15.1759 9 15.5875 9 16.0182C9 16.6653 9.518 17.1899 10.157 17.1899H13.843C14.482 17.1899 15 16.6653 15 16.0182C15 15.5875 15.1756 15.1759 15.4854 14.8807L16.5894 13.8283C18.1306 12.3481 18.9912 10.4034 18.9999 8.3817L19 8.29678C19 4.84243 15.866 2 12 2C8.13401 2 5 4.84243 5 8.29678L5.00007 8.3817C5.00875 10.4034 5.86939 12.3481 7.41058 13.8283Z\"/>\n                    </svg>\n                <span><strong>Tip:</strong></span>\n                </span>\n                The value of `gr.NO_RELOAD` is `True`.

Simply run the file with `python` instead of `gradio`.\n            </p>\n                \n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nif gr.NO_RELOAD:\n\tfrom transformers import pipeline\n\tpipe = pipeline(\"text-classification\", model=\"cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest\")\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(lambda s: pipe(s), gr.Textbox(), gr.Label())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.launch()\n```\n\n\n## Jupyter Notebook Magic \ud83d\udd2e\n\nWhat about if you use Jupyter Notebooks (or Colab Notebooks, etc.) to develop code? We got something for you too!\n\nWe've developed a **magic command** that will create and run a Blocks demo for you. To use this, load the gradio extension at the top of your notebook:\n\n`%load_ext gradio`\n\nThen, in the cell that you are developing your Gradio demo, simply write the magic command **`%%blocks`** at the top, and then write the layout and components like you would normally:\n\n```py\n%%blocks\n\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(f\"# Greetings {args.name}!\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox()\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n\n    inp.change(fn=lambda x: x, inputs=inp, outputs=out)\n```\n\nNotice that:\n\n- You do not need to launch your demo \u2014 Gradio does that for you automatically!\n\n- Every time you rerun the cell, Gradio will re-render your app on the same port and using the same underlying web server. This means you'll see your changes _much, much faster_ than if you were rerunning the cell normally.\n\nHere's what it looks like in a jupyter notebook:\n\n![](https://gradio-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/demo-files/jupyter_reload.gif)\n\n\ud83e\ude84 This works in colab notebooks too! [Here's a colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zAuWoiTIb3O2oitbtVb2_ekv1K6ggtC1?usp=sharing) where you can see the Blocks magic in action. Try making some changes and re-running the cell with the Gradio code!\n\nThe Notebook Magic is now the author's preferred way of building Gradio demos. Regardless of how you write Python code, we hope either of these methods will give you a much better development experience using Gradio.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you know how to develop quickly using Gradio, start building your own!\n\nIf you are looking for inspiration, try exploring demos other people have built with Gradio, [browse public Hugging Face Spaces](http://hf.space/) \ud83e\udd17\n", "tags": [], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/developing-faster-with-reload-mode/", "contributor": null}}
