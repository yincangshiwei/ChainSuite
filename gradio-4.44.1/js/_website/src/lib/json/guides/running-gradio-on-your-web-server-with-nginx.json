Gradio apps can be deployed on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://hf.space) for free.\n\nIn some cases though, you might want to deploy a Gradio app on your own web server. You might already be using [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), a highly performant web server, to serve your website (say `https://www.example.com`), and you want to attach Gradio to a specific subpath on your website (e.g. `https://www.example.com/gradio-demo`).\n\nIn this Guide, we will guide you through the process of running a Gradio app behind Nginx on your own web server to achieve this.\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n1. A Linux web server with [Nginx installed](https://www.nginx.com/blog/setting-up-nginx/) and [Gradio installed](/quickstart)\n2. A working Gradio app saved as a python file on your web server\n\n## Editing your Nginx configuration file\n\n1. Start by editing the Nginx configuration file on your web server. By default, this is located at: `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`\n\nIn the `http` block, add the following line to include server block configurations from a separate file:\n\n```bash\ninclude /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;\n```\n\n2. Create a new file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available` directory (create the directory if it does not already exist), using a filename that represents your app, for example: `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_gradio_app`\n\n3. Paste the following into your file editor:\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name example.com www.example.com;  # Change this to your domain name\n\n    location /gradio-demo/ {  # Change this if you'd like to server your Gradio app on a different path\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7860/; # Change this if your Gradio app will be running on a different port\n        proxy_buffering off;\n        proxy_redirect off;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n            <p class='tip'>\n                <span class=\"inline-flex\" style=\"align-items: baseline\">\n                    <svg class=\"self-center w-5 h-5 mx-1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"800px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"currentColor\">\n                        <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M9.25 18.7089C9.25 18.2894 9.58579 17.9494 10 17.9494H14C14.4142 17.9494 14.75 18.2894 14.75 18.7089C14.75 19.1283 14.4142 19.4684 14 19.4684H10C9.58579 19.4684 9.25 19.1283 9.25 18.7089ZM9.91667 21.2405C9.91667 20.821 10.2525 20.481 10.6667 20.481H13.3333C13.7475 20.481 14.0833 20.821 14.0833 21.2405C14.0833 21.66 13.7475 22 13.3333 22H10.6667C10.2525 22 9.91667 21.66 9.91667 21.2405Z\"/>\n                        <path d=\"M7.41058 13.8283L8.51463 14.8807C8.82437 15.1759 9 15.5875 9 16.0182C9 16.6653 9.518 17.1899 10.157 17.1899H13.843C14.482 17.1899 15 16.6653 15 16.0182C15 15.5875 15.1756 15.1759 15.4854 14.8807L16.5894 13.8283C18.1306 12.3481 18.9912 10.4034 18.9999 8.3817L19 8.29678C19 4.84243 15.866 2 12 2C8.13401 2 5 4.84243 5 8.29678L5.00007 8.3817C5.00875 10.4034 5.86939 12.3481 7.41058 13.8283Z\"/>\n                    </svg>\n                <span><strong>Tip:</strong></span>\n                </span>\n                Setting the `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers is important as Gradio uses these, in conjunction with the `root_path` parameter discussed below, to construct the public URL that your app is being served on. Gradio uses the public URL to fetch various static assets. If these headers are not set, your Gradio app may load in a broken state.\n            </p>\n                \n\n*Note:* The `$host` variable does not include the host port. If you are serving your Gradio application on a raw IP address and port, you should use the `$http_host` variable instead, in these lines:\n\n```bash\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;\n```\n\n## Run your Gradio app on your web server\n\n1. Before you launch your Gradio app, you'll need to set the `root_path` to be the same as the subpath that you specified in your nginx configuration. This is necessary for Gradio to run on any subpath besides the root of the domain.\n\n    *Note:* Instead of a subpath, you can also provide a complete URL for `root_path` (beginning with `http` or `https`) in which case the `root_path` is treated as an absolute URL instead of a URL suffix (but in this case, you'll need to update the `root_path` if the domain changes).\n\nHere's a simple example of a Gradio app with a custom `root_path` corresponding to the Nginx configuration above.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport time\n\ndef test(x):\ntime.sleep(4)\nreturn x\n\ngr.Interface(test, \"textbox\", \"textbox\").queue().launch(root_path=\"/gradio-demo\")\n```\n\n2. Start a `tmux` session by typing `tmux` and pressing enter (optional)\n\nIt's recommended that you run your Gradio app in a `tmux` session so that you can keep it running in the background easily\n\n3. Then, start your Gradio app. Simply type in `python` followed by the name of your Gradio python file. By default, your app will run on `localhost:7860`, but if it starts on a different port, you will need to update the nginx configuration file above.\n\n## Restart Nginx\n\n1. If you are in a tmux session, exit by typing CTRL+B (or CMD+B), followed by the \"D\" key.\n\n2. Finally, restart nginx by running `sudo systemctl restart nginx`.\n\nAnd that's it! If you visit `https://example.com/gradio-demo` on your browser, you should see your Gradio app running there\n\n", "tags": ["DEPLOYMENT", "WEB SERVER", "NGINX"], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/running-gradio-on-your-web-server-with-nginx/", "contributor": null}}
