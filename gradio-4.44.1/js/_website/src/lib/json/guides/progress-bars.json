In order to enable this, simply add an argument to your method that has a default value of a `gr.Progress` instance. Then you can update the progress levels by calling this instance directly with a float between 0 and 1, or using the `tqdm()` method of the `Progress` instance to track progress over an iterable, as shown below.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport time\n\ndef slowly_reverse(word, progress=gr.Progress()):\n    progress(0, desc=\"Starting\")\n    time.sleep(1)\n    progress(0.05)\n    new_string = \"\"\n    for letter in progress.tqdm(word, desc=\"Reversing\"):\n        time.sleep(0.25)\n        new_string = letter + new_string  \n    return new_string\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(slowly_reverse, gr.Text(), gr.Text())\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/progress_simple'></gradio-app>\n\nIf you use the `tqdm` library, you can even report progress updates automatically from any `tqdm.tqdm` that already exists within your function by setting the default argument as `gr.Progress(track_tqdm=True)`!\n", "tags": [], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/progress-bars/", "contributor": null}}
