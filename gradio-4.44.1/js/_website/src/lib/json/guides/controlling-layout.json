Let's take a look at how we can rearrange Components. Under the hood, this layout structure uses the [flexbox model of web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox).\n\n## Rows\n\nElements within a `with gr.Row` clause will all be displayed horizontally. For example, to display two Buttons side by side:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        btn1 = gr.Button(\"Button 1\")\n        btn2 = gr.Button(\"Button 2\")\n```\n\nBy default, every element in a Row will have the same height. Configure this with the `equal_height` argument.\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row(equal_height=False):\n        textbox = gr.Textbox()\n        btn2 = gr.Button(\"Button 2\")\n```\n\nThe widths of elements in a Row can be controlled via a combination of `scale` and `min_width` arguments that are present in every Component.\n\n- `scale` is an integer that defines how an element will take up space in a Row. If scale is set to `0`, the element will not expand to take up space. If scale is set to `1` or greater, the element will expand. Multiple elements in a row will expand proportional to their scale. Below, `btn2` will expand twice as much as `btn1`, while `btn0` will not expand at all:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        btn0 = gr.Button(\"Button 0\", scale=0)\n        btn1 = gr.Button(\"Button 1\", scale=1)\n        btn2 = gr.Button(\"Button 2\", scale=2)\n```\n\n- `min_width` will set the minimum width the element will take. The Row will wrap if there isn't sufficient space to satisfy all `min_width` values.\n\nLearn more about Rows in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs/row).\n\n## Columns and Nesting\n\nComponents within a Column will be placed vertically atop each other. Since the vertical layout is the default layout for Blocks apps anyway, to be useful, Columns are usually nested within Rows. For example:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        text1 = gr.Textbox(label=\"t1\")\n        slider2 = gr.Textbox(label=\"s2\")\n        drop3 = gr.Dropdown([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], label=\"d3\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column(scale=1, min_width=300):\n            text1 = gr.Textbox(label=\"prompt 1\")\n            text2 = gr.Textbox(label=\"prompt 2\")\n            inbtw = gr.Button(\"Between\")\n            text4 = gr.Textbox(label=\"prompt 1\")\n            text5 = gr.Textbox(label=\"prompt 2\")\n        with gr.Column(scale=2, min_width=300):\n            img1 = gr.Image(\"images/cheetah.jpg\")\n            btn = gr.Button(\"Go\")\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/rows_and_columns'></gradio-app>\n\nSee how the first column has two Textboxes arranged vertically. The second column has an Image and Button arranged vertically. Notice how the relative widths of the two columns is set by the `scale` parameter. The column with twice the `scale` value takes up twice the width.\n\nLearn more about Columns in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs/column).\n\n# Fill Browser Height / Width\n\nTo make an app take the full width of the browser by removing the side padding, use `gr.Blocks(fill_width=True)`. \n\nTo make top level Components expand to take the full height of the browser, use `fill_height` and apply scale to the expanding Components.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks(fill_height=True) as demo:\n    gr.Chatbot(scale=1)\n    gr.Textbox(scale=0)\n```\n\n## Dimensions\n\nSome components support setting height and width. These parameters accept either a number (interpreted as pixels) or a string. Using a string allows the direct application of any CSS unit to the encapsulating Block element.\n\nBelow is an example illustrating the use of viewport width (vw):\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    im = gr.ImageEditor(width=\"50vw\")\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n## Tabs and Accordions\n\nYou can also create Tabs using the `with gr.Tab('tab_name'):` clause. Any component created inside of a `with gr.Tab('tab_name'):` context appears in that tab. Consecutive Tab clauses are grouped together so that a single tab can be selected at one time, and only the components within that Tab's context are shown.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef flip_text(x):\n    return x[::-1]\n\ndef flip_image(x):\n    return np.fliplr(x)\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"Flip text or image files using this demo.\")\n    with gr.Tab(\"Flip Text\"):\n        text_input = gr.Textbox()\n        text_output = gr.Textbox()\n        text_button = gr.Button(\"Flip\")\n    with gr.Tab(\"Flip Image\"):\n        with gr.Row():\n            image_input = gr.Image()\n            image_output = gr.Image()\n        image_button = gr.Button(\"Flip\")\n\n    with gr.Accordion(\"Open for More!\", open=False):\n        gr.Markdown(\"Look at me...\")\n        temp_slider = gr.Slider(\n            0, 1,\n            value=0.1,\n            step=0.1,\n            interactive=True,\n            label=\"Slide me\",\n        )\n\n    text_button.click(flip_text, inputs=text_input, outputs=text_output)\n    image_button.click(flip_image, inputs=image_input, outputs=image_output)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_flipper'></gradio-app>\n\nAlso note the `gr.Accordion('label')` in this example. The Accordion is a layout that can be toggled open or closed. Like `Tabs`, it is a layout element that can selectively hide or show content. Any components that are defined inside of a `with gr.Accordion('label'):` will be hidden or shown when the accordion's toggle icon is clicked.\n\nLearn more about [Tabs](https://gradio.app/docs/tab) and [Accordions](https://gradio.app/docs/accordion) in the docs.\n\n## Visibility\n\nBoth Components and Layout elements have a `visible` argument that can set initially and also updated. Setting `gr.Column(visible=...)` on a Column can be used to show or hide a set of Components.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    name_box = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\")\n    age_box = gr.Number(label=\"Age\", minimum=0, maximum=100)\n    symptoms_box = gr.CheckboxGroup([\"Cough\", \"Fever\", \"Runny Nose\"])\n    submit_btn = gr.Button(\"Submit\")\n\n    with gr.Column(visible=False) as output_col:\n        diagnosis_box = gr.Textbox(label=\"Diagnosis\")\n        patient_summary_box = gr.Textbox(label=\"Patient Summary\")\n\n    def submit(name, age, symptoms):\n        return {\n            submit_btn: gr.Button(visible=False),\n            output_col: gr.Column(visible=True),\n            diagnosis_box: \"covid\" if \"Cough\" in symptoms else \"flu\",\n            patient_summary_box: f\"{name}, {age} y/o\",\n        }\n\n    submit_btn.click(\n        submit,\n        [name_box, age_box, symptoms_box],\n        [submit_btn, diagnosis_box, patient_summary_box, output_col],\n    )\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_form'></gradio-app>\n\n## Defining and Rendering Components Separately\n\nIn some cases, you might want to define components before you actually render them in your UI. For instance, you might want to show an examples section using `gr.Examples` above the corresponding `gr.Textbox` input. Since `gr.Examples` requires as a parameter the input component object, you will need to first define the input component, but then render it later, after you have defined the `gr.Examples` object.\n\nThe solution to this is to define the `gr.Textbox` outside of the `gr.Blocks()` scope and use the component's `.render()` method wherever you'd like it placed in the UI.\n\nHere's a full code example:\n\n```python\ninput_textbox = gr.Textbox()\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Examples([\"hello\", \"bonjour\", \"merhaba\"], input_textbox)\n    input_textbox.render()\n```\n", "tags": [], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/controlling-layout/", "contributor": null}}
